* Biological path Towards Strong AI

@rhylight

** Movement
- Understand the world by moving, interacting with the environment
** Layers And Columns
- columns within layers
** Sparse Distributed Representation
- sparsity and distribution of neurons are important
- only 2% are on at any point
- Similarity score
- overlap with input-space
- spatial pooling
- cells become active and predictive

* Running Programs in Reverse

** Psychology
- varying displacement and rotation
- mental simulation as unifying theory in cognition

** Robotics
- inverse simulation to figure out what needs to be done to get the output you want

** Julia
- multi method dispatch
- can look at the generated code from the language

* Lazy Defenses: Using Scaled TTLs to Keep your Cache Correct

* Aesthetic Engine 2

- Generative brutalist art projects

* "It Me": Under the Hood of Web Authentication

** Passwords
- Adobe passwords hacked were encrypted, not hashed + salted
- 2M users were using the same password, we know passwords because hints were not encrypted

** Sessions
- By framework & send an ID
- Persistent on client
  - cookies
  - {local,session}Storage
    - vulnerable to XSS but Content-Security-Policy can help
- Sessions are signed(not encrypted)

** Is the timing difference measureable over the network?
2007 paper

** Timing-safe string comparison
- protect against timing attack based on how long verification takes
- constant time comparison
- there's no guarantee that it will take exactly same time
- can use HMAC

** Beyond Passwords
MFA

** U2F/FIDO

- challenge, signature and validate

* Antics, drift, and chaos

** John Gall - system isn't doing what it says
- Netflix is a monitoring company with video streaming byproduct - Adrian Crockford

** Fault-Tolerance isn't composable
- Peter Alvaro

** Checks in Formal verification systems
- Most bugs in shim layer as opposed to the
** ETTO Principle
- Efficiency, Thoroughness tradeoff
** Decrementalism
- things get slowly worse over time within an organization
- how strict or thorough they are changes over time
** Normalization of Deviance
- Diane Vaughn

** Simple Systems -> Large Systems evolution

** Chaos Monkey
- Make wrong things harder
*** Chaos Engineering
- Take empirical approach and experiment
- Find vulnerabilities before they cause outage
- External Validity problem
  - You don't get the external validity unless you run on the sample
- CHAP
  - CHaos Automation Platform
- EVCache example
  - Clone URL
  - Route to two clusters
  - Look at behavior & difference between control and experiments
- http://principlesofchaos.org
  - Build hypothesis around steady state
  - Vary real-world events
  - Run experiments in production
  - Automate Experiments to Run Continuously
  - Minimize Blast Radius
** Summary
- Systems behave pathologically, but can use experiments to find the problems
- Chaos provide incentives

** Books
- The Systems Bible
- Drift Into Failure
- Chaos Engineering book

* Universal Reason

- OCaml/Reason that compiles to javascript

** Frontends are Fragile
** Compartmentalizing state
- reducer component has some state and has methods to update the state

** No impedance mismatch
** Adoption
Messenger.com -> total bugs introduced in the year: 10
** Lightweight higher order functions
