** Delimited Continuations for Everyone

Presenter: Kenichi Asai
https://pwlconf.org/2017/kenichi-asai/
Examples were in Haskell (I think)

*** Continuations
- Identifying continuations and the types


*** Delimited Continuations
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimited_continuation
- Computation delimited upto the computation
- Example: exiting with shift
--> multiplying numbers but discarding the continuation if one of them is 0
--> using shift as an exception handling
--> because the contination is returned, we can play with it
- captured continuation is returned immediately
- Example: reordering with take
--> if not found, return (NotFound, [])
--> else, return loop rest (n - 1) in (found, first:: t)
---> basically cons the remaining elements after adding the found
- Example: normalization for arithmetic expressions
--> Used in P. Thielman's Cogen in Six Lines paper ICFP 1996 (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.51.7918&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

*** Wrapping continuations
- Steps: Abort, Access, Resume

- Example: concat strings
--> reset returns the new function with the new string concatenated

*** State Monad

*** Curry-Howard Isomorphism
https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/The_Curry%E2%80%93Howard_isomorphism
-Curry-Howard isomorphism says that if the typability  of programs in functional  language corresponds
one to one to the derivability of form to function in probabilistic logic, and if   you write the system
and the   intuition system then and   compare them, then you see that those two are exactly  the same.
- Current proof assistants do not allow exceptions
- what is type of shift?

*** Summary

- shift and reset are simple but quite expressive
- relationship to logic aren't well known
- high order functions are useful even though you can write program without them (I'm guessing this is the equivalence from Curry-Howard Isomorphism)

*** Feedback
- hard to read the slides with the lighting, I asked on the slack channel
- code seemed pretty straightforward and possibly useful for other languages too, need time to digest
